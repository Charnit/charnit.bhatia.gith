        <p>
            I am currently a fourth-year Business Technology Management student at Toronto Metropolitan University. My program blends business and technology, 
            covering areas like data analytics, information systems, and project management.
            The most useful course for me was ACC 406. It taught me practical business accounting skills and provided hands-on experience, helping me understand
            real-world financial decision-making.
